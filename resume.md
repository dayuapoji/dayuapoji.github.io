I am a Ph.D. candidate in civil & environmental engineering with a designated emphasis in computational & data science engineering, at the University of California Berkeley. I am currently working on the implementation of artificial intelligence and machine learning in earth pressure balance shield machine (EPBM) tunneling. Our goal is to develop a framework for autonomous EPBM systems.

I am also a certified geotechnical engineer (Indonesia) with more than 8 years of work experience in the engineering and construction industry. Prior to joining UC Berkeley, I worked for engineering firms such as RHDHV Indonesia and AECOM Singapore. During this period, I was involved in various building and infrastructure projects across Indonesia and Southeast Asia region (i.e. Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Timor Leste).

I obtained my civil engineering degrees from ITB, Indonesia, and Imperial College London, UK.
